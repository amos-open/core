-- Performance Test: BI Access Pattern Optimization
-- Task 5.2: Optimize materialization strategies for BI access patterns
-- Requirements: 2.3, 2.4, 2.5

-- This test validates that materialization strategies are optimized for common BI access patterns
-- and that the instrument-centric design provides efficient query performance
